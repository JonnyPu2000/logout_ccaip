# User  Manager for CCAIP

This project is designed for managing user statuses in teams using the Contact Center AI Platform (CCAIP). It allows you to collect the names and IDs of users, monitor their statuses, and enforce logout actions based on specific criteria (status other than "Available" and inactivity for more than 3 hours). The project features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, enabling interaction with the data and presenting it in an organized table format.
